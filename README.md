- Hi! My name is Ben Vicinelli.
- I am a junior at Wake Forest University from Larchmont, NY. I studied abroad this past fall at King's College London.
- I have been coding mostly in Java, but I also know Python, C, C#, and Git.
- Some technologies I'm familiar with are Java Spring Boot, Pygame, Mockito, Postman, Apache Maven, Jira, and more.
- I am currently interning as a Software Engineer at Walmart Global Tech.
- For my internship, I am building an API to automate and therefore reduce upload time for micro frontends to a shell application.
- In my free time, I am learning frontend programming languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React).
- You can reach me at 914-216-5915 or benvicinelli@yahoo.com
