# Hello! I'm Ben Vicinelli.

I am from Larchmont, NY but currently live in San Francisco, CA. I graduated from Wake Forest University in 2024 with a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Studio Art. I currently work as a backend Software Engineer II for Walmart Global Tech in Sunnyvale, CA.

## Languages and Technologies âŒ¨

I have been coding mostly in Java, but I also know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Python, C, C#, and Git.

Some technologies I'm familiar with are Java Spring Boot, Pygame, Mockito, Postman, Apache Maven, Jira, and more.

In my free time, I am learning frontend programming languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React).
