# Hello! I'm Ben Vicinelli.

I am from Larchmont, NY and a Computer Science major entering my senior year at Wake Forest University.

## Languages and Technologies ⌨

I have been coding mostly in Java, but I also know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Python, C, C#, and Git.

Some technologies I'm familiar with are Java Spring Boot, Pygame, Mockito, Postman, Apache Maven, Jira, and more.

In my free time, I am learning frontend programming languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React).

## My Current Project 🚀

At Walmart Global Tech, I'm building a versioning tool that uses APIs to automate and revolutionize the deployment and update process for micro frontends to a shell UI.
